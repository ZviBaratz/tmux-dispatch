# Features

Cross-cutting features that work across multiple modes.

- [Mode Switching](mode-switching) -- Type prefix characters (`>`, `@`, `!`, `#`) to switch between modes without closing the popup. Backspace on an empty query returns to the file finder.
- [Bookmarks & Frecency](bookmarks) -- Pin files with `Ctrl+B` for persistent access (shown with ★). Frecency ranking surfaces recently and frequently opened files at the top of the list.
- [Preview System](previews) -- Syntax-highlighted file previews (via bat), line-highlighted grep previews, git diff previews, and session/window grid previews with pane content.
